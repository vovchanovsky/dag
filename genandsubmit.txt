This class has three methods:

generate_self_signed_certificate: This method generates a self-signed certificate for a device, using the steps outlined in the earlier message.
submit_certificate: This method encrypts the device's self-signed certificate using the fog node's public key, and then submits the encrypted certificate to the fog node.
decrypt_certificate: This method decrypts the encrypted certificate received by the fog node, using its private key.
You can create an instance of this class by passing in the fog node's public key as a parameter. For example:
fog_node_public_key = b'-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIICIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCA
